================================
Ella universal commenting system
================================

This application is inspired by django.contrib.comments
but the major difference between them is ella.comments
is using newforms from django trunk.

Also there is used only one model in ella.comments.

Set up is pretty easy as is installing any other django application::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        [...]
        'ella.comments',
        [...]
    )

And after then you have got full access to usefull templatetags::

    {% load comments %}

    {% get_comment_form for object as comment_form %}
    {% get_comment_list for testapp.apple with id 1 as comment_list orderby -submit_date %}
    {% get_comment_count for object as comment_count %}

Also you can use special inclusion tag::

    {% get_comment_list for object as comment_list %}
    {% for comment in comment_list %}
    {% print_comment comment %}
