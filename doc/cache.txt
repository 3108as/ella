====================
Ella Cache mechanism
====================

Ella uses `Django's caching mechanism`_ internally to cache individual values.

.. _Django's caching mechanism: http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/cache/

Cache levels
============

Ella caches content on multiple levels, from the lowest - caching individual
objects (both individual and lists) as they come from the database to caching
entire boxes on the output.  Some time consuming calculations such as the tag
cloud, comments count etc. are cached separately via a `cache_this`_
decorator.

Cached templates
================

Ella provides a template loader (``ella.core.cache.template_loader``) that
caches the template sources.

Cache invalidation
==================

Every cache registers with CacheInvalidator a set of tests, which are then run
against every changed object. If a test passes, the cache is destroyed.
